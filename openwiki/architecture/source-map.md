`src/` is an authored-content tree, not the public site map. `DocumentationBuilder` materializes supported inputs in `build/`; `src/docs.json` separately declares Mintlify navigation, redirects, and OpenAPI configuration. A route can therefore be emitted but unlisted, listed under a label unrelated to its directory, or listed in more than one navigation location. For example, `src/langsmith/fleet/` maps to `/langsmith/fleet/` but appears as **No-code agents**.

This diagram separates builder-owned route emission from Mintlify presentation and deployment-generated API reference.

## Ownership boundaries

| Concern | Owner | Safe change rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Page transformation and emitted paths | `src/` and `pipeline/core/builder.py` | Pick the source family based on output behavior, then inspect the emitted path. |
| Menu, dropdown, tab, group, ordering, and visibility | `src/docs.json` | Add an emitted route explicitly; source placement alone does not create navigation. |
| Historical URLs | `docs.json` redirects | Redirect old paths instead of keeping duplicate authored pages. |
| Snippets and static inputs | `src/snippets/`, images, fonts, `.well-known`, root CSS/JS, and `docs.json` | Treat them as imports or copied inputs, not ordinary navigation pages. |
| API endpoint reference | OpenAPI entries in `docs.json` and Mintlify deployment | Change the specification/configuration, not an imagined endpoint MDX file. |

## Builder route families

`build_all()` clears the output, emits Python and JavaScript OSS trees, emits Deep Agents Code and OpenWiki once, emits ordinary LangSmith content and Managed Deep Agents variants, then copies shared inputs and generates `llms` indexes. `TEMPLATE.mdx` and unsupported file types are skipped.

| Authored input | Emitted route or artifact | Important behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shared OSS content such as `src/oss/langchain/`, `langgraph/`, and `deepagents/` except `code/` | `/oss/python/...` and `/oss/javascript/...` | Conditional `:::python` and `:::js` content resolves for each target. |
| `src/oss/python/` and `src/oss/javascript/` | Only the corresponding language route tree | The source-language segment is removed from the output path; the other language subtree is skipped. |
| `src/oss/openwiki/` | `/oss/openwiki/...` once | Python conditional-content branch; no language copies. |
| `src/oss/deepagents/code/` | `/oss/deepagents/code/...` once | Python conditional-content branch; no language copies. |
| Ordinary `src/langsmith/` files | `/langsmith/...` | Built through the Python target, including Test, Deploy, Monitor, setup, and Engine pages. |
| Direct `src/langsmith/managed-deep-agents*.mdx` files | `/langsmith/python/...` and `/langsmith/javascript/...` | Excluded from ordinary unversioned LangSmith emission. |
| `src/snippets/` | Importable MDX and component inputs | Snippets are shared inputs, not navigation pages. |
| Images, fonts, `.well-known`, root CSS/JS, and `docs.json` | Corresponding shared build paths | Site assets and configuration are copied once. |

### Language-aware transformation

For a language-targeted MDX file, preprocessing happens before link rewrites. The builder scopes MDX snippet imports to `/snippets/python/` or `/snippets/javascript/`, prefixes eligible absolute `/oss/` links, and maps unversioned Managed Deep Agents links to the target-language route. It leaves already-qualified OSS paths, image paths, and the unversioned OpenWiki and Deep Agents Code roots intact.

Use an explicit `/oss/python/` or `/oss/javascript/` link only when intentionally targeting that language. Use an eligible unqualified `/oss/` link when the current target should choose the language. The unversioned products use the Python transform, so links from their pages to ordinary shared OSS pages resolve to Python, while links inside their own product root remain unprefixed.

## Navigation is a projection, not a directory listing

The **AGENT DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE** product has Home, Build, Test, Deploy, and Monitor. Build has Python and TypeScript dropdowns; its tabs can reference both OSS and LangSmith output. The **PRODUCTS AND SETUP** product exposes setup and standalone product surfaces. Thus `src/langsmith/` is not a single public section: its ordinary files can appear under Test, Deploy, Monitor, setup, or a product item.

Important projections in the current navigation are:

- **No-code agents** is the navigation label for the `/langsmith/fleet/` source and route family.
- **OpenWiki** lists the same unversioned `/oss/openwiki/...` pages in both Build dropdowns. This is duplicated Mintlify presentation, not two route trees.
- **Deep Agents Code** is an unversioned **Products and setup** item. Its expanded Configuration group is rooted at `oss/deepagents/code/configuration` and contains credentials, config file, hooks, and MCP tools. The configuration landing page documents separate resolution orders for general options, provider API keys, dotenv files, and provider endpoints.
- **Engine** is a distinct **Products and setup** item with six flat routes: `langsmith/engine-overview`, `engine`, `engine-github`, `engine-notifications`, `engine-security`, and `engine-self-hosted`. The overview positions it as the LangSmith agent for agent engineering; the operational page documents a closed issue lifecycle from recurring trace detection through diagnosis, proposed pull request, tracking/dataset generation, and automatic reopening when the issue resurfaces.

### LangSmith evaluation surface

The Test menu makes evaluation concepts and evaluator management separate navigation responsibilities even though they share the flat `src/langsmith/` source directory:

- **Get started** contains `evaluation`, `evaluation-quickstart`, `evaluation-concepts`, and `evaluation-approaches`. `evaluation-concepts` establishes the lifecycle distinction: offline evaluation works against dataset examples with optional reference outputs, while online evaluation works against production runs and threads without reference outputs.
- **Datasets & Experiments** owns dataset creation, running an evaluation, target and scoring techniques, experiment configuration and analysis, tutorials, and common data types.
- **Evaluators** begins with `evaluation-types`, `evaluators`, SDK management, dataset binding, and evaluator spend. It then divides extension routes into **Evaluator types** (UI and SDK), **Frameworks & integrations**, and **Improve evaluators**. Keep a new evaluator-management or implementation page in this tab; do not infer its position from the `langsmith/` filename.

`evaluators.mdx` documents reusable workspace-level evaluators. An evaluator can attach to multiple tracing projects and datasets, whereas attachment-specific configuration such as sampling, filters, spend limits, and online trace-retention behavior belongs to the attachment. In particular, an evaluator cannot be deleted while attached; detach it from every project or dataset first.

### Language-specific Integration groups

The Build **Integrations** tab is intentionally different per dropdown, not merely a label swap. Python has **Popular Providers** and **Integrations by component**. The latter includes both `oss/python/integrations/checkpointers/index` and `oss/python/integrations/long-term-memory/index`: checkpointers persist and resume LangGraph state, while stores persist and retrieve long-term memory across threads. TypeScript has **Popular Providers**, **General integrations**, and **RAG integrations**. Place an integration in the matching language subtree and explicitly add its emitted route to the appropriate group.

### Managed Deep Agents variants and redirects

A direct `managed-deep-agents*.mdx` source has two emitted variants. `docs.json` lists the Python variants in the Python Build **Managed Deep Agents** tab and the JavaScript variants in the TypeScript tab; each has **Get started**, **Agent capabilities**, and **Build and deploy** groups. The deploy page is consequently one authored source with Python and JavaScript CLI fences, rather than two independently maintained pages.

`docs.json` redirects unversioned Managed Deep Agents URLs—including `/langsmith/managed-deep-agents-overview` and `/langsmith/managed-deep-agents-deploy`—to Python routes. Do not add an unversioned MDX duplicate: the builder deliberately omits it, avoiding a route outside the managed navigation.

## OpenAPI and generated inputs

`docs.json` configures three OpenAPI reference surfaces:

| Surface | Specification source | Route directory when configured |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent Server API | Committed `src/langsmith/agent-server-openapi.json` | `/langsmith/agent-server-api/` |
| Control Plane API | Remote `https://api.host.langchain.com/openapi.json` | Mintlify reference surface |
| LangSmith REST API | Committed `src/langsmith/langsmith-platform-openapi.json` | `/langsmith/smith-api/` |

The LangSmith REST input declares an OpenAPI 3.1 LangSmith API and documents API-key authentication through `X-Api-Key`; it is a committed specification input, not authored endpoint MDX. Mintlify creates endpoint pages during deployment. For locally sourced OpenAPI groups with a `directory`, the builder derives `llms` index entries from the specification, omits hidden operations, and skips unavailable or outside-build specifications.

## Invariants, validation, and safe changes

- Source traversal rejects symlinks and files resolving outside the collection root, preventing committed source paths from incorporating host files into artifacts.
- Extend `tests/unit_tests/test_builder.py` when changing routing, unversioned-product treatment, snippets, or link rewriting. Focused tests cover language-specific snippets, unversioned output, Managed Deep Agents variants, link preservation, and source containment.
- Run `make build` to inspect output. Run `make broken-links` afterward: it builds first, invokes Mintlify with redirect validation, and filters deployment-only OpenAPI paths and standalone snippet reports that would otherwise be local false positives.

## Change checklist

1. Begin with the required public route and identify its emission family; do not infer it from a menu label.
2. For normal shared OSS content, check Python and TypeScript output. For OpenWiki and Deep Agents Code, check only the unversioned output.
3. Update route emission and `docs.json` placement independently. Keep the two OpenWiki presentations aligned.
4. For evaluation pages, distinguish concepts and datasets/experiments from evaluator implementation and management, then place the route in the Test tab and group named by `docs.json`.
5. For Managed Deep Agents, add or change the source once, validate both language variants, and preserve the unversioned-to-Python redirect convention.
6. For API reference, change the spec/configuration rather than adding endpoint MDX; run focused tests and link checks before relying on the route or redirect.
